exp1: delete[] not called.exp2: delete[] not called, out of bounds in array.exp3: variable x is not initialized and used, may cause odd behavior.exp4: variable y is not initialized for the function call. exp5: out of range; attempting to write data in a non-allocated area of memory.exp6: reading data from an empty (deleted) memory block. The address the program attempts to refer to is 0 bytes long. exp7: used delete instead of delete[]exp8: used free instead of delete[]exp9: delete[] won’t free all the memory since the pointer has been moved from the start of allocated memory.exp10: incorrect usage of unsigned int; unsigned int doesn't have range below 0 to store the result of  20 - 30 = -10. There is no problems with memory.
